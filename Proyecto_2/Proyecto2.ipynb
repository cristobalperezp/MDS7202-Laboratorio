notar que existen 2 que no son capaces de superar este baseline, y no pudiendo capturar ningún cliente mal pagador. El mejor clasificador entrenado es LGBM, logrando una precision en test de 0.55, se puede explicar este resultado debido a que este es un modelo que se entrena sobre muchos clasificadores débiles, los cuales corrigen los errores obtenidos por cada clasificador débil, además de ser un modelo que junto a XGBoost, funcionan bien en datos tabulares, y son de los más sofisticados sin considerar redes neuronales.\n","Considerando optimizaciones a realizar, y tiempos de entrenamiento, LGBM es un algoritmo liviano, de ahí su nombre, que es trabajado para ser más eficiente en su entrenamiento (0.4
